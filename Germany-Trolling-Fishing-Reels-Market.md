Manual trolling reels are widely used by anglers for their simplicity, control, and reliability, making them a popular choice in the German market. These reels are preferred by many fishing enthusiasts who enjoy the hands-on experience and traditional fishing techniques. The manual reels are further categorized by their gear ratios, drag systems, and line capacities, allowing users to select according to their specific needs for different fish species and water conditions. With growing interest in competitive fishing, manual reels remain a strong segment within the market due to their cost-effectiveness and long-lasting performance.<p>On the other hand, electric trolling fishing reels are gaining traction in the German market, offering high-tech solutions to anglers who seek convenience and efficiency. These reels are typically preferred for deep-sea fishing and when targeting larger fish species, as they can handle greater line capacities and pull more weight effortlessly. Electric trolling reels provide consistent performance and reduce the physical strain of manual cranking, making them ideal for long fishing trips. Although electric reels come at a higher price point, the increasing demand for advanced fishing equipment and the growing popularity of recreational and professional fishing in Germany contribute to the market's steady growth in this segment.
