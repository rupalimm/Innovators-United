Hemodialysis remains the dominant application, offering a solution for patients whose kidneys can no longer filter waste from their blood. This method involves diverting blood into a machine where it is cleaned and then returned to the body. The growing prevalence of ESRD has driven advancements in hemodialysis technology, enhancing the efficiency and comfort of the treatment. The market for hemodialysis is buoyed by an increasing number of dialysis centers and home-based hemodialysis systems, reflecting the demand for more accessible and flexible treatment options. Innovations in hemodialysis machines, including automated systems and integrated monitoring, are contributing to the segment's robust growth.</p><p>On the other hand, peritoneal dialysis is gaining traction as an alternative application, offering patients a method of dialysis that can be performed at home. This technique utilizes the patient's peritoneal membrane as a natural filter, with a dialysis solution introduced into the abdominal cavity to remove waste and excess fluids. The appeal of peritoneal dialysis lies in its potential for a more flexible lifestyle, reduced need for frequent visits to dialysis centers, and fewer dietary restrictions compared to hemodialysis. The increasing adoption of peritoneal dialysis is supported by ongoing research and development aimed at improving the safety, ease of use, and effectiveness of the treatment. As healthcare systems focus on personalized patient care, the peritoneal dialysis segment is poised for significant growth within the ESRD treatment market.</p></p><p id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Reseach Report @ <a target="">https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=599934&utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=262</a></strong></p><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Treatment Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Fresenius</Li><Li> DaVita</Li><Li> Baxter</Li><Li> Nipro</Li><Li> B.
