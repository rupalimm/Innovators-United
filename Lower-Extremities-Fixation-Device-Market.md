The market's growth is primarily driven by the increasing incidence of lower extremities fractures, advancements in surgical procedures, and the growing demand for minimally invasive surgeries. Additionally, the rising geriatric population and the increasing number of road accidents are contributing to the rising demand for lower extremities fixation devices, such as plates, screws, and external fixation devices, in hospitals and orthopedic clinics.</p><h2>Lower Extremities Fixation Device Market, By Application Segmentation</h2><p>In the Lower Extremities Fixation Device Market, the application segment is broadly categorized into hip, knee, ankle, and others. The knee segment dominates the market, driven by the high prevalence of knee fractures and ligament injuries, which often require fixation devices like screws and plates for stabilization. Moreover, the development of advanced fixation technologies such as locking plates and screws has further contributed to the demand for knee fixation devices. As the number of knee surgeries increases, driven by the aging population and growing awareness about advanced orthopedic treatments, the segment is expected to continue its dominance during the forecast period.</p><h2>Lower Extremities Fixation Device Market, By Application Segmentation</h2><p>The hip and ankle segments are also witnessing significant growth within the Lower Extremities Fixation Device Market. Hip fractures, especially in the elderly, require efficient fixation systems, leading to an increasing demand for hip fixation devices such as intramedullary nails and dynamic hip screws. The ankle fixation devices, which include plates and screws, are seeing rising demand due to higher rates of traumatic injuries and fractures. Additionally, advances in materials used for fixation devices, such as titanium and bioabsorbable materials, are improving patient outcomes and driving the growth of these application segments. As trauma and accident rates remain high, these two segments are expected to experience robust growth throughout the forecast period.</p></h3><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Lower Extremities Fixation Device Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Depuy Synthes (J&J)</Li><Li> Stryker</Li><Li> Zimmer Biomet</Li><Li> Smith & Nephew</Li><Li> Wright Medical</Li><Li> Acumed</Li><Li> B Braun</Li><Li> OsteoMed</Li><Li> Orthofix</Li><Li> Medartis</Li><Li> Globus Medical</Li><Li> Lima Corporate</Li><Li> Medtronic</Li><Li> MicroPort</h3><h3 id="ember53" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Global&nbsp;Lower Extremities Fixation Device Market Segmentation:</h3><p id="ember54" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Segmentation analysis involves dividing the market into distinct groups based on certain criteria, such as type and application.
